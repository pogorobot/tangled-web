A snaky, narrow corridor that twists and turns.

The passage forks in three directions.

A large stone table dominates the room.

Stalactites poke up from the ground.

Blue algae grows on the walls, giving off a soft, eerie light.

You almost think you can see one of your friends. Alas, you shake your head and the image dissipates.

The world is spinning, spinning. You can't quite find your footing.

The ceiling is far above you. Too far to see.

Are you a cherry tree? Sometimes I think I might be a cherry tree.

Absalom, Absalom!

I'm so, so sorry.
