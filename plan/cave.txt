CONSTRAINTS:

Two dimensional (x, y)
One room per point
Nothing negative - start at (0, 0)
Constrained by a rectangle of (width, height)
Exits match up
No more than three exits per room
Every room accessible from every other room

Other than that, totally random

PROCESS:

On Maze:

Set the width and height
Initialize the grid of Rooms

On Room: hey look I converted to real code

def initialize(x, y)
  @possible_configurations = all_possible_configurations
  @x = x
  @y = y
end

def configure
  @configuration = @possible_configurations[rand(@possible_configurations).length]
  if violating_constraints
    @nogoods[@current_assumption] = @configuration
    @possible_configurations.delete @configuration
    if @possible_configurations.length > 0
      configure
    else
      @previous_room.nogood(@current_assumption)
    end
  else
    @next_room.assume(@configuration)
  end
end

STORAGE

  def violating_constraints #omg you guys this method is so important, seriously seriously seriously
    #currently two constraints that matter here:
    #every room matches up
    #aand every room accessibllle
    #so we need to check if this particular configuration works with that
    #to check if every exit matches, check if every room has an exit to this room
    #to check if every room is accessible,
    #check if this room can ... hm how do you check that hm

    #haha okay I think I figured it out
    #basically you have to check if it's theoretically possible that this room could connect to something that
    #connects to something that connects to Room One
    #so for each exit:
    #if the room it exits to is @connectable
    #you're good
    #if the room it exits to is a descendant -ie lower on the stack
    #you're also good, on the assumption that someone down there will figure it out
    #if no exit has those properties, you're not good
  end
